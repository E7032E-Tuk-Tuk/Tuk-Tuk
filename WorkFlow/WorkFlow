THIS DOCUMENT WILL NOW BE SORTED BY THE WEEK THE TASK GOT DONE, NOT THE SUBJECT OF THE TASK
----Week 50----

Wrote on the report, 2 meetings, working on implementing gyro :)
- Jack 2023-12-11 (08-1830)

Implemented the TV controller in vanilla C (like it's 1972...)
- Magnus

Worked on accelerometer and gyro
-Jack 2023-12-16 (15-2030)

Getting values for the acceleration and location from the ICM20948 (maybe working as intended)
- Jack 2023-12-17 (13-18)

----Week 49----

Written in the report about Modelica and FMI
- Emma // 2023-12-05

Fixed sending and recieving extended IDs over CAN bus
Jack, Jim 2023-12-04

Added an experimental anti-spin feature to the controller
- Magnus // Week 49

----Week 48----

Played around with the torque controller model that I downloaded last week. Now have a sense
of what is in a troque controller for a BLDC motor. No luck in finding how the switching is 
done effiecently.
- Samuel // 2023-11-28 13:00-15:30

Finally found how the switching scheme is designed and how to implement it in a efficient manner.
Haven't written about it in the report yet.
- Samuel // 2023-11-29 13:26-16:58

Looking into ways of tuning the PID-controller when it is on the Tuk-Tuk. Found that the most conventional methods didn't work.
The pidTuner app in Matlab can be good to use, where a state-space estimation can be made from measured input-output data. 
This model can then be pre-tuned in Matlab before tested on the Tuk-Tuk.
- Emma // 2023-12-01

Added a scenario to test the longitudinal behaviour of the simulated vehicle. Resulted in a "mu-slip curve" which looks about right.
- Magnus // Week 48

Also plotted the lateral force on the front wheel as a function of the slip angle.
- Magnus // Week 48

Writing about Vehicle Dynamics in the report
- Magnus // Week 48

----Simulation Modelica----
Finding model of car-wheel with slip implemented. Practice simulating with modelica. 
Testing different dimensions (1D-3D) but found 2D modeling with library PlanarMechanics is the simpliest 
without loosing too much (slip not possible to model in 1D).
-Emma // 2023-09-14

Working on a 3-wheel and a 4-wheel vehicle using PlanarMechanics. The base model is there, but I'm currently 
working on the steering and how to implement Ackermann's steering.
-Emma // 2023-09-22

The 3-wheel and 4-wheel vehicles are now fully steerable. Had to make a PI-controller of the torque
acting on a rotor that turns the wheel to the angle you want.
-Emma // 2023-10-02

Working on the 3-wheel model to prepare it to be exported as an FMU. 
Looking into wheel slip to understand how slip is implemented in the model of the wheels.
-Emma // 2023-10-10

Upgrading the model to contain rolling resistance and weight transfer. Writing about the upgrade in the report.
-Emma // 2023-10-20

----Main Controll Unit----
Setting up okdo x radxa rock 4 se 4gb. // 2023-09-18
-Jim, Jack

----Motor Drives----
Searching for motor drivers 
We have been looking for suitable motor drivers and found one to our specifications: https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller // 5h 2023-09-11 - 2023-09-12
-Jim, Jack och Samuel.

Testing motor driver
Fixed so we can try out the motor driver with motor using a power supply // 3h 2023-09-14
-Jim

Testing motor drivers with motors // 2023-09-15
-Jim, Jack

Wrote about four quadrant operation for motor in the report // 2023-09-19
-Samuel

Changed connectors on the motors to fit the VESC. // 2023-09-20
-Jim, Samuel

Started writting about motor drivers in the report // 2023-09-21

Reading about motor configuration (star or delta), how to choose with transistor is on (switching scheme) and what the frequency of the PWM should be. // 20203-11-16
- Samuel

Downloaded a motor model with a torque contoller to examine how to drive the motor // 2023-11-23
- Samuel // Two hours.

----Torque Vectoring controller----
Continued reading resources (papers etc) on Torque Vectoring in order to clear up some details and decide on the most viable implementation for the project.
- Magnus // Week 37

Studied fundamental vehicle dynamics to expand our theoretical framework, which can be used in modelling as well as control.
- Magnus // Week 37

Explored MathWorks Vehicle Dynamics Blockset as a possible alternative simulation environment (will probably not be used - Modelica simulation environment is progressing well).
- Magnus // Week 37

Continued studying vehicle dynamics
- Magnus // Week 38

Sketched some control architectures for the yaw rate controller (Basic P/PI/PD/PID vs State space controller, thinking about how to handle the nonlinearity w.r.t. vehicle speed, e.g. use gain scheduling approach or make the whole controller nonlinear?)
- Magnus // Week 38

Implemented a simple PI yaw rate controller in Simulink
- Magnus // Week 39

Had a meeting with Khalid to discuss control architecture
- Magnus // Week 41

Combined the Modelica FMU with the yaw-rate controller in Simulink. It was almost working, but the steering angle is internally controlled by a PI in the FMU which caused nasty oscillations. Should either find a quick fix or resort to using Vehicle Dynamics Blockset for now.
- Magnus // Week 41

Forgot to update this document. An exam period a while back led to a slowdown in the project. Otherwise mostly been working back and forth with Emma to request additional functionality in the FMU, and implemented the updated FMUs in Simulink. Tested various simulation scenarios and vehicle parameters. Writing about vehicle dynamics in the report.
- Magnus // Weeks 42-48

Added a scenario to test the longitudinal behaviour of the simulated vehicle. Resulted in a "mu-slip curve" which looks about right.
- Magnus // Week 48

Also plotted the lateral force on the front wheel as a function of the slip angle.

Added an experimental anti-spin feature to the controller
- Magnus // Week 49
