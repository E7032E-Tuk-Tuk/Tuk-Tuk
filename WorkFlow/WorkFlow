----Simulation Modelica----
Finding model of car-wheel with slip implemented. Practice simulating with modelica. 
Testing different dimensions (1D-3D) but found 2D modeling with library PlanarMechanics is the simpliest 
without loosing too much (slip not possible to model in 1D).
-Emma // 2023-09-14
Working on a 3-wheel and a 4-wheel vehicle using PlanarMechanics. The base model is there, but I'm currently 
working on the steering and how to implement Ackermann's steering.

----Motor Drives----
Searching for motor drivers 
We have been looking for suitable motor drivers and found one to our specifications: https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller // 5h 2023-09-11 - 2023-09-12

----Torque Vectoring controller----
Continued reading resources (papers etc) on Torque Vectoring in order to clear up some details and decide on the most viable implementation for the project.
- Magnus // Week 37

Studied fundamental vehicle dynamics to expand our theoretical framework, which can be used in modelling as well as control.
- Magnus // Week 37

Explored MathWorks Vehicle Dynamics Blockset as a possible alternative simulation environment (will probably not be used - Modelica simulation environment is progressing well).
- Magnus // Week 37

Continued studying vehicle dynamics
- Magnus // Week 38

Sketched some control architectures for the yaw rate controller (Basic P/PI/PD/PID vs State space controller, thinking about how to handle the nonlinearity w.r.t. vehicle speed, e.g. use gain scheduling approach or make the whole controller nonlinear?)
- Magnus // Week 38

----Platform----
Made a sketch for the diffrent forces on the car and looked into the EOM (Equations of Motion) 2023-08-23
-Alex

Made a blooprint of how to contruct a box car out of a loading plint, including steering wheel, drive-shafts, dampning-springs and other. 2023-09-06
-Alex

Mailed and searched for infomation about how to get a pre-built platform, such as a GoKart or of the like. 2023-09-18
-Alex

"Found" a big RC platform at EXP-el that we could use temporarily. // 2023-09-20
- Jim

Researched about the gokart "Segway Ninebot GoKart Pro". It has one motor per back wheel! // 2023-09-21
- Samuel

Discussed and looked for alternatives for our test vehicle
- Everybody // Week 38

----Battery Management System----
Wrote a bit about batteries in the report.
- Samuel // Week 37
Wrote a bit more about batteries and changed formationg in the report // 2023-09-20
