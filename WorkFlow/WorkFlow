----Simulation Modelica----
Finding model of car-wheel with slip implemented. Practice simulating with modelica. 
Testing different dimensions (1D-3D) but found 2D modeling with library PlanarMechanics is the simpliest without loosing too much (slip not possible to model in 1D).

----Motor Drives----
Searching for motor drivers 
We have been looking for suitable motor drivers and found one to our specifications: https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller // 5h 2023-09-11 - 2023-09-12

Testing motor driver
Fixed so we can try out the motor driver with motor using a power supply // 3h 2023-09-14

----Torque Vectoring controller----
Continued reading resources (papers etc) on Torque Vectoring in order to clear up some details and decide on the most viable implementation for the project.
- Magnus // Week 37
Studied fundamental vehicle dynamics to expand our theoretical framework, which can be used in modelling as well as control.
- Magnus // Week 37
Explored MathWorks Vehicle Dynamics Blockset as a possible alternative simulation environment (will probably not be used - Modelica simulation environment is progressing well).
