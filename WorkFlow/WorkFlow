----Simulation Modelica----
Finding model of car-wheel with slip implemented. Practice simulating with modelica. 
Testing different dimensions (1D-3D) but found 2D modeling with library PlanarMechanics is the simpliest 
without loosing too much (slip not possible to model in 1D).
-Emma // 2023-09-14

Working on a 3-wheel and a 4-wheel vehicle using PlanarMechanics. The base model is there, but I'm currently 
working on the steering and how to implement Ackermann's steering.
-Emma // 2023-09-22

The 3-wheel and 4-wheel vehicles are now fully steerable. Had to make a PI-controller of the torque
acting on a rotor that turns the wheel to the angle you want.
-Emma // 2023-10-02

Working on the 3-wheel model to prepare it to be exported as an FMU. 
Looking into wheel slip to understand how slip is implemented in the model of the wheels.
-Emma // 2023-10-10

Upgrading the model to contain rolling resistance and weight transfer. Writing about the upgrade in the report.

----Main Controll Unit----
Setting up okdo x radxa rock 4 se 4gb. // 2023-09-18
-Jim, Jack

----Motor Drives----
Searching for motor drivers 
We have been looking for suitable motor drivers and found one to our specifications: https://flipsky.net/products/torque-esc-vesc-%C2%AE-bldc-electronic-speed-controller // 5h 2023-09-11 - 2023-09-12
-Jim, Jack och Samuel.

Testing motor driver
Fixed so we can try out the motor driver with motor using a power supply // 3h 2023-09-14

Testing motor drivers with motors // 2023-09-15
-Jim, Jack

Wrote about four quadrant operation for motor in the report // 2023-09-19
-Samuel

Changed connectors on the motors to fit the VESC. // 2023-09-20
-Jim, Samuel

Started writting about motor drivers in the report // 2023-09-21
-Jim

Reading about motor configuration (star or delta), how to choose with transistor is on (switching scheme) and what the frequency of the PWM should be. // 20203-11-16

----Torque Vectoring controller----
Continued reading resources (papers etc) on Torque Vectoring in order to clear up some details and decide on the most viable implementation for the project.
- Magnus // Week 37

Studied fundamental vehicle dynamics to expand our theoretical framework, which can be used in modelling as well as control.
- Magnus // Week 37

Explored MathWorks Vehicle Dynamics Blockset as a possible alternative simulation environment (will probably not be used - Modelica simulation environment is progressing well).
- Magnus // Week 37

Continued studying vehicle dynamics
- Magnus // Week 38

Sketched some control architectures for the yaw rate controller (Basic P/PI/PD/PID vs State space controller, thinking about how to handle the nonlinearity w.r.t. vehicle speed, e.g. use gain scheduling approach or make the whole controller nonlinear?)
- Magnus // Week 38

Implemented a simple PI yaw rate controller in Simulink
- Magnus // Week 39

Had a meeting with Khalid to discuss control architecture
- Magnus // Week 41

Combined the Modelica FMU with the yaw-rate controller in Simulink. It was almost working, but the steering angle is internally controlled by a PI in the FMU which caused nasty oscillations. Should either find a quick fix or resort to using Vehicle Dynamics Blockset for now.
- Magnus // Week 41

----Platform----
Made a sketch for the diffrent forces on the car and looked into the EOM (Equations of Motion) 2023-08-23
-Alex

Made a blooprint of how to contruct a box car out of a loading plint, including steering wheel, drive-shafts, dampning-springs and other. 2023-09-06
-Alex

Mailed and searched for infomation about how to get a pre-built platform, such as a GoKart or of the like. 2023-09-18
