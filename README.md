Goals of project:

Scalable: The solution should be able to be used on model vehicles as well as real vehicles.

Modular: The solution has to be modular so that a three wheel vehicle could have one, two, or three
motors, a four wheel vehicle could have one, two, three, or four motors. The motor controllers must
communicate with each other.

Re-generation: Since the vehicles aim to address energy waste, regeneration of electrical energy
upon slowdowns and braking are required.

Battery management: Charging and discharging batteries is a complex operation when done
correctly. It has to be done within the project.
